# servlet-sample-project

Created a simple java web project and then converted it to a maven project.
The jsp page has a simple form to submit (no styling whatsoever).
The form submit request will be handled by the servlet's doPost method.
The servlet has doGet and doPost methods to get the jsp form page and handle the form submit respectively.

The aim of this project was just to have a reference of servlets basics and is not, by all means, a production ready code.
Maybe in future I will refine this app.
